                web and full-stack developer. I have
                strong skills in HTML and
                CSS and am
                actively learning JavaScript. Im working on various web projects, including a mobile-friendly website
                for a construction company in Hebrew, focusing on modern design, dark mode functionality, and responsive

                cybersecurity and AI/ML.
